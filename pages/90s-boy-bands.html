                    <p style="width: calc(100% - 400px); font-size: 8px; margin: auto;">According to Wikipedia, "A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band" target="_blank">boy band</a> is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers who also dance on stage, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation, singing love songs marketed towards young women. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer.[non sequitur] However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances. <br> Some such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or gospel music groups, but are often created by talent managers or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of preteens, teenyboppers, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in music journalism. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, girl groups. Boy bands' popularity peaked four times: in the 1960s (e.g., The Jackson 5), in the 1990s and early 2000s when acts such as the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, A1 and Westlife, among others, dominated the top of the Billboard and pop charts."</p>

                    <p>The Backstreet Boys are an all american boyband formed in Orlando, Florida in 1993. The group consists of 5 members:</p>

                    <h2>Boyz II Men</h2>
                    <p style="width: calc(100% - 400px); font-size: 8px; margin: auto;">"During the 1990s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyz_II_Men">Boyz II Men</a> gained international success. This began with the release of top 5 singles "Motownphilly" and "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" in 1991, followed by the number one single "End of the Road" in 1992, which reached the top of charts worldwide.[2] "End of the Road" set a new record for longevity, staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for thirteen weeks, breaking the decades-old record held by Elvis Presley. Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of "I'll Make Love to You" and "One Sweet Day" (with Mariah Carey), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. "I'll Make Love to You" also topped the charts in Australia (for four weeks) and garnered international success." (Wikipediea)</p>
